      <h1>PASSIVE ADOPTIONS</h1>
      <p>
        &emsp;Have you ever wanted a pet but for some reason couldn’t have one? Maybe your apartment doesn’t allow animals or maybe <br/>you have a family member who’s allergic, but whatever the reason, you simply can’t have a pet of your own. <br/>Or maybe you already have one too many at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        CARE gives you the chance to become a godparent to an animal in need via passive adoption.<br/> The highlight of our shelter, is without a doubt, our permanent residents. There are people who have sworn that every time you <br/>spend time with them and walk out, it feels like they have completed a session of therapy. The animals at CARE have fought their own battles, and emerged as true heroes who take it as their duty to spread love among visitors. They are heroes who don’t wear capes.

      <h2>How do I Passively Adopt?</h2>
      <p>
        Passive adoption gives you the opportunity to sponsor one of our permanent resident animals at CARE, <br/>for just Rs. 1000 a month. With this small contribution, you would be providing food, medicine, and other necessities <br/>for animals that need to remain at the shelter due to pre-existing circumstances. In return, the shelter will keep you updated on your pet by <br/>sending you pictures and news, and you can even come and visit them whenever you’re in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please remember, CARE constantly gets new animals, so we’ll try to keep this deck as updated as possible.
